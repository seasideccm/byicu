This powerful tool provides otherwise unattainable physiologic data and may occasionally obviate the need for computed tomography (CT) imaging and its transport and radiation risks. Recently, studies have begun defining its clinical role in the adult intensive care unit (ICU), rendering EIT an emerging, important tool in the intensivist\u2019s arsenal. This paper reviews the current clinical applications of EIT for the clinician unfamiliar with the complex equations, physics, and technical details underlying its use. Ongoing research must focus on harnessing its unique properties to help advance and revolutionize ICU management.</p><h3 id="basic-principles-of-electrical-impedance-tomography" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#basic-principles-of-electrical-impedance-tomography" aria-hidden="true">#</a> BASIC PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE TOMOGRAPHY</h3><p>The scientific principles behind EIT have been previously described[<a href="#1">1,2</a>]. Here, we briefly review the basic concepts necessary for clinical integration of EIT. EIT equipment includes a thoracic belt with up to 32 electrodes connected to a console and monitor (Fig. 1a). Electrical resistivity declines as alveoli stretch and thin during the respiratory cycle, enabling EIT to detect inflation changes (Fig. 1b).</p><h2 id="key-points" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#key-points" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <strong>KEY POINTS</strong></h2><ul><li>\u2022 EIT is a noninvasive, radiation-free monitoring tool to assess and visualize regional ventilation and perfusion.</li><li>\u2022 EIT is currently predominantly a research tool, but rapidly emerging data are helping to define its clinical role.</li><li>\u2022 EIT may prove to be a key component of a multimodal approach to individualizing ventilator management, as has been demonstrated by our Lung Rescue Team.</li></ul><p>This provides excellent temporal, but limited spatial, resolution. Precise localization of regional distribution is limited but timing of changes can be viewed at 50 images per second, akin to a video. EIT can identify regional inhomogeneity, including pendelluft and concomitant overdistention and atelectasis, that would otherwise be masked by systemic ventilator-based metrics (i.e., airway pressures and tidal volumes). Using similar principles, EIT can also detect the distribution of blood flow by arresting the respiratory cycle while administering 10 mL of hypertonic saline, with implications as outlined later in this review[<a href="#4">3,4</a>](Fig. 1c).</p><p>EIT measurements have been validated as accurate surrogates for tidal volume and ventilation distribution compared to CT[<a href="#5">5</a>], and end-expiratory lung volume compared to nitrogen washout[<a href="#6">6</a>]. Indices using various EIT measurements are subjects of ongoing research, including the \u2019global inhomogeneity index\u2019, capturing regional heterogeneity of ventilation distribution[<a href="#7">7</a>], \u2019regional ventilation delay\u2019, characterizing temporal heterogeneity[<a href="#8">8</a>], and \u2019dynamic relative regional strain\u2019, indexing tidal impedance to end-expiratory lung impedance, which correlated with disease course in 10 COVID patients[<a href="#9">9</a>].</p><h3 id="identifying-appropriate-positive-end-expiratory-pressure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#identifying-appropriate-positive-end-expiratory-pressure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> IDENTIFYING APPROPRIATE POSITIVE END-EXPIRATORY PRESSURE</h3><p>Since EIT can uniquely identify regional overdistention, much clinical research has applied EIT to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration for patients in respiratory failure, particularly with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The everpresent challenge is to maximize the recruitment and patency of atelectatic, dependent lung while minimizing overdistention of ventral, nondependent lung, thereby avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury and untoward hemodynamic effects[<a href="#10">10,11</a>].</p><p>Costa et al. first used EIT to identify changes in tidal compliance (using EIT-derived tidal volume and ventilator-derived driving pressure) during a decremental PEEP titration after maximal recruitment, theorizing that worsening compliance with increasing PEEP was due to overdistention, worsening compliance with reducing PEEP was due to collapse, and that ideal PEEP was where overdistention and atelectasis were minimized[<a href="#12">12</a>](Fig. 2). Although this assumes that overdistention and collapse are equally harmful, and some disagree[<a href="#13">13</a>], this technique has been validated in various ICU populations[<a href="#14">14,15,16</a>] and launched significant further research. In 2019, Costa\u2019s method of PEEP titration was compared to using static pressure-volume curves in 55 patients with severe ARDS. The EIT group had higher PEEP, better compliance, and lower driving pressure after 2 h, and ultimately better hospital survival[<a href="#17">17</a>]. In 2021, a similar study of 87 patients with moderate to severe ARDS revealed lower PEEP, lower driving pressure, and improved survival with an EIT-based PEEP approach[<a href="#18">18</a>]. The discrepancy in higher and lower optimal PEEP between these studies simply reflects the difference in optimal PEEP in each sample population and demonstrates that EIT can identify appropriate PEEP in both directions.</p><p>FIGURE 1. Basic EIT equipment and output. In panel a, a drawing of an EIT console connected to an electrode belt placed on a patient\u2019s thorax is shown. Panel b demonstrates output imaging demonstrating relative regional ventilation across four quadrants. Panel c demonstrates output imaging demonstrating relative regional distribution of perfusion.

In panel a, a decremental PEEP titration after a recruitment maneuver yielded a graphic depiction and tabulation of the percentage of lung collapse, hyperdistention, and respiratory system compliance, at each given PEEP. Based on Costa\u2019s method, the best PEEP would be approximately 1012 cm H2O, where the hyperdistention and collapse curves overlap and compliance is greatest. In panel b, the EIT images at higher PEEPs of 16 and 14 cmH2O demonstrate no improvement in the distribution of ventilation while worsening driving pressure and respiratory system compliance. EIT, electrical impedance tomography; PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure.</p><p>An alternative method using EIT to set PEEP at the level required to maintain end-expiratory lung volume within 10% of that achieved during a recruitment maneuver was validated to improve driving pressure in patients with ARDS compared to ARDSNet tables[<a href="#19">19</a>], as well as to set PEEP for patients with severe asthma[<a href="#20">20</a>]and on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for severe ARDS[<a href="#21">21</a>].</p><p>These two methods were compared and found overall to not significantly differ in PEEP achieved, but with notable discrepancies in 3 patients[<a href="#22">22</a>], highlighting the need for further research.</p><h3 id="lung-rescue-team-and-obesity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lung-rescue-team-and-obesity" aria-hidden="true">#</a> LUNG RESCUE TEAM AND OBESITY</h3><p>In 2014, the Lung Rescue Team (LRT) at Massachusetts General Hospital incorporated EIT into a multimodal approach ultimately including esophageal manometry and bedside echocardiography to guide ventilator management, particularly for challenging recruitment and PEEP titrations in obese patients with ARDS, where the combination of unknown lung elasticity related to ARDS and increased pleural pressure from obesity renders appropriate PEEP widely variable, difficult to guess, and often requiring otherwise concerning excessively high applied airway pressures.</p><p>In a 2019 crossover study, we compared PEEP titration in 14 severely obese patients with ARDS via ARDSNet tables vs. esophageal manometry alone vs. the LRT approach determining best respiratory system compliance during a post-recruitment maneuver decremental PEEP trial[<a href="#23">23</a>]. The LRT group had the least lung overdistention and collapse, better compliance, and better oxygenation. Retrospectively, the LRT approach was safe, efficient, and effective at guiding ICU management[<a href="#24">24</a>], yielded higher PEEP for patients with BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 without causing hemodynamic instability or overdistention[<a href="#25">25</a>], was associated with improved survival in patients with a BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 (31% vs. 16% mortality at 28 days and 41% vs. 22% at 1 year)[<a href="#26">26</a>], and was associated with reduced need for ECMO in patients with a BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2[<a href="#27">27</a>]. This compelling data supports the benefit, even on mortality, of individualizing ventilatory management, and the role of EIT in this pursuit.</p><h3 id="ventilator-dyssynchrony" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ventilator-dyssynchrony" aria-hidden="true">#</a> VENTILATOR DYSSYNCHRONY</h3><p>In 2013, EIT was demonstrated to detect pendelluft in patients with lung injury and revealed its generation via spontaneous effort[<a href="#28">28</a>]. This likely injurious phenomenon can only be detected by technologies, like EIT, that identify regional changes in lung distention over time, otherwise masked by global, ventilator-guided parameters. In 2018, a higher PEEP strategy was shown to attenuate pendelluft[<a href="#29">29</a>]. Ongoing research is assessing the methodology of EIT-based pendelluft measurements[<a href="#30">30</a>].</p><p>Breath stacking, another form of ventilator dys-synchrony that can yield harmful, large tidal volumes, is often missed on ventilator waveforms and can be caught by EIT[<a href="#31">31,32,33</a>]. Given the timeconsuming nature of EIT and the variability of how and when breath stacking occurs, EIT is unlikely to become a screening tool for breath stacking, but it may be incidentally discovered when utilizing EIT for other purposes.</p><h3 id="pulmonary-embolism-detection-and-ventilation-perfusion-matching" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pulmonary-embolism-detection-and-ventilation-perfusion-matching" aria-hidden="true">#</a> PULMONARY EMBOLISM DETECTION AND VENTILATION-PERFUSION MATCHING</h3><p>EIT assessment of perfusion distribution requires injection and electrical impedance measurement of approximately 10mL of hypertonic saline during an end-expiratory pause. EIT was demonstrated to detect ventilation-perfusion (VQ) mismatch in a region of known pulmonary embolism (PE)[<a href="#34">34</a>], prompting a prospective observational study that validated this finding[<a href="#35">35</a>]. EIT was performed on 68 ICU patients with hypoxemia, 11 with known PE. Using an impedance cutoff of 20% of maximum to define ventilation and perfusion, regions of the pure shunt (perfusion without ventilation), dead space ventilation (ventilation without perfusion), and ventilation with perfusion were identified. Patients with diffuse lung disease had no defect in regional ventilation and perfusion. A patient with hemothorax had defective ventilation and perfusion in the affected area. Patients with pulmonary emboli had more dead space ventilation, worse VQ mismatch, and less intrapulmonary shunting compared to others. A cutoff of 30% dead space ventilation would have identified a PE with 91% sensitivity and 99% specificity in this cohort.</p><p>Notably, unlike CT which can detect and localize an intravascular obstruction, and can do so regardless of regional ventilation, EIT cannot distinguish between intravascular and extravascular causes of perfusion impairment, and with the aforementioned method, will discount diminished perfusion in areas of diminished ventilation, even when the perfusion deficit is due to PE and the ventilation deficit is due to another cause. EIT does offer the advantages of bedside availability, radiation-free testing, and performance without intravenous contrast. Thus, whereas EIT is unlikely to prove diagnostically equivalent to CT for PE, it may prove sufficiently helpful to guide clinical decision-making for individual unstable patients. Additionally, by lowering the percentage dead space ventilation cutoff, improving sensitivity at the cost of specificity, EIT may prove capable of definitively ruling out PE. Further study is needed before broadly applying EIT to PE diagnostic algorithms.</p><p>Recently, EIT was used to quantify VQ mismatch in patients with ARDS, and mortality was associated with worse matching[<a href="#36">36</a>]. There may therefore be a future prognostic role for EIT as well.</p><h3 id="covid-19-applications" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#covid-19-applications" aria-hidden="true">#</a> COVID-19 APPLICATIONS</h3><p>The COVID pandemic generated further EIT studies encompassing applications already discussed with results applicable to COVID patients and likely broader ARDS patient populations.</p><h3 id="positive-end-expiratory-pressure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#positive-end-expiratory-pressure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Positive end-expiratory pressure</h3><p>In a series of 15 patients with COVID ARDS and a mean BMI of 30 kg/m2, EIT-based PEEP selection via Costa\u2019s method (with an additional 2cmH2O) correlated with the higher ARDSNet PEEP tables without causing hemodynamic instability or pneumothorax[<a href="#37">37</a>]. In another series of 15 patients with a lower BMI of 30 kg/m2, EIT-derived best PEEP by Costa\u2019s method resulted in PEEP levels similar to the ARDSNet tables with the exception of 3 patients [<a href="#38">38</a>]. This approach guided two consecutive ECMO runs in one peripartum patient, who survived[<a href="#39">39</a>]. These studies demonstrate the variable physiology of COVID ARDS, suggest that individualized titration may be more appropriate than relying on ARDS-Net tables, and highlight the need for continued research, consistent with the numerous aforementioned studies with similar findings in broad ARDS pre-COVID.</p><h3 id="lung-perfusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#lung-perfusion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Lung perfusion</h3><p>Our group reported successful application of EIT to diagnose and initiate treatment for a PE, on the basis of homogenous ventilation and imbalanced perfusion, in an intubated, prone patient with COVID ARDS, with the diagnosis subsequently confirmed by CT after stabilization a day later[<a href="#40">40</a>]. In a pandemic with resource constraints, the added risk of infectious spread by transporting patients, in addition to the known harms of contrast, radiation, and transport of clinically unstable patients, EIT proved a valuable and safe alternative.</p><h3 id="novel-uses" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#novel-uses" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Novel uses</h3><p>One observational study of 5 patients used EIT to successfully demonstrate that titrating PEEP with targeted lateral positioning to keep the less aerated side higher yielded less regional overdistention and collapse and improved right-left lung aeration/ven-tilation asymmetry[<a href="#41">41</a>]. Another study of 10 nonintubated patients with COVID ARDS used EIT to measure changes in end-expiratory lung impedance during single PEEP de-escalation (from 12 to 6 mmH2O) via continuous positive airway pressure before intubation. Those with less than 40% change when PEEP was deescalated while supine (n = 4) ultimately failed CPAP, were intubated, and did not survive, whereas those with &gt;50% change did not require intubation and survived, suggesting more prognostic potential for EIT to predict outcomes and possibly identify patients who may benefit from earlier intubation[<a href="#42">42</a>].</p><h3 id="miscellaneous-and-future-directions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#miscellaneous-and-future-directions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> MISCELLANEOUS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS</h3><p>A summary of the key studies validating the previously discussed clinical applications is delineated in</p><p>Table 1.

Improved ventilation homogeneity and lung compliance is a proposed mechanism of the mortality benefit of proning during ARDS, and EIT may eventually help predict who might benefit from pronation before attempting. Currently, this concept remains premature and would be difficult to study absent equipoise in withholding pronation in patients with ARDS for whom it is otherwise indicated.</p><h3 id="ventilator-weaning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ventilator-weaning" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ventilator weaning</h3><p>EIT has been employed to monitor spontaneous breathing trials (SbT)[<a href="#45">45</a>]. A 2019 observational study used EIT to monitor 30-min low-PEEP (2 cm H2O) SBTs and the immediate post-extubation period for those who passed[<a href="#46">46</a>]. There were no differences in tidal volume changes or arterial blood gases in those who passed and failed the SBT, but those who failed demonstrated a significant reduction in tidal impedance and baseline inhomogeneity index, suggesting a potential role for EIT in predicting successful SBTs and as an adjunct for postextubation monitoring.</p><h3 id="monitoring-lungs-on-venovenous-extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#monitoring-lungs-on-venovenous-extracorporeal-membrane-oxygenation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Monitoring lungs on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation</h3><p>Studies have evaluated distribution of ventilation on ultraprotective ventilator settings for patients on venovenous ECMO[<a href="#15">15,16</a>]. Optimal PEEP can be selected to minimize collapse and overdistention, but no studies have yet demonstrated that such PEEP selection has any effect on ECMO outcomes, nor that it even differs significantly from PEEP set by alternative methods. One study demonstrated that the physiologic benefits of pronation apply to ECMO patients as well[<a href="#47">47</a>]. In 21 patients, EIT- based median optimal PEEP was reduced by 4 cmH2O when prone vs. supine, congruent with improved static compliance &gt;3 mL/cmH2O in over 60% of patients.
